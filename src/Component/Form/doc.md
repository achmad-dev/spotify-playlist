1. The form is a controlled form, so the state of the form is controlled by the user.
2. We are using the useState hook to manage the state of the form.
3. The first argument of useState is the initial state of the form, and the second argument is a function that changes the state of the form.
4. We use the setForm function to change the state of the form.
5. The state of the form is updated as the user inputs data in the form.
6. We use the handleChange function to update the state of the form.
7. We use the handleForm function to handle the submission of the form.
8. The handleForm function uses the sendFormNetworkCall function to send the form data to spotify api.
